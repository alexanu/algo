- Program compiles and runs:
    # python3 daemon.py
- Market was closed upon committing new code, so I wasn't able to verify that it actually works correctly.
- Doesn't do anything if market is closed. Need to add checking for this.
- Broke program down into several classes.
- Fleshed out "50/50" strategy a bit. Need to add babysitting of TP/SL.
- Thought of a reason why algo shouldn't run automatically on bootup, but I forget what that was.

-   Modified startup script (/etc/init.d/daemon_init.sh)
    +   Added case statement to explicitly only run on system bootup
    +   Manually removed copies of the script from /etc/rc0.d/ , /rc1.d/ , and /rc6.d/
        This should not have been necessary if I specify the Startup-Default etc. values in the script and run
        #update-rc.d daemon.sh defaults
        But it works now so I will not dwell on it.
