Each algorithm class contains 3 functions:
- initialize
- run
- shutdown

These public functions are called by the main platform program.
The initialize() function is called once and is used to initialize variables and whatever else.
The run() function is called over and over.
The shutdown() function is called once when the algorithm routine needs to be ended.
