Use templates as a starting point when developing new backtest scripts.

TODO
- factor in bid/ask spreads, if Pi Trading data doesn't already.
- Take out taxes annually rather than once at end of test.
- pass in delay: # of days to go without trading after each sell
- Don't tax if loss
- Instead of iterating through a list of test values in the backtest caller,
    specify a range and step value.
